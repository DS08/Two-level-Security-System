# Two-level-Security-System
Operating System Security (Two level)
This project is under work and need to be implemented more

Project Aim : Develop security System for Operating Systems.Two level Security
First level - Simple alphanumeric password box
Second Level - After succesfull authentication of first level,Image authentication will take place

Note: It is implemented till all Image Processing.But not deployed on Operating System

Some Precautions in Project : (1) The image cannot be taken in dim light and correspondingly show error for it.
                              (2) Developed till Image comparison and not deployed on Operating System.So therefore,instead of login ,
                                  I have just shown the logged in username after succesful authentication(i.e completion of two levels)
                                  
                                  
Future works : (1)Deploy it on open source for eg-linux.
               (2) Make it work for dim light too.
